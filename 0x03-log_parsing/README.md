# 0x03. Log Parsing

This repository contains exercises and examples related to log parsing algorithms implemented in Python. It covers techniques for extracting information from log files and converting them into structured data for further analysis.

## Table of Contents
- [0-stats.py](./0-stats.py)

## Skills
- Algorithm development
- Python
- Log parsing

## Requirements
- Python 3.5 or higher

## Usage
To run the examples in this repository, you will need to have Python 3.5 or higher installed. You can then use the `python3` command to run the script files. The scripts take a log file as an argument and output statistics about the log data.
