This repository covers basic implementation of UTF-8 validation in python, it provides a function that can be used to validate whether a given byte sequence is a valid UTF-8 encoded string or not. It is important for any Back-end developer to have a good understanding of character encoding and how to validate the input data to ensure the security and correctness of the system.
